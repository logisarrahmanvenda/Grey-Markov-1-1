# Grey-Markov-1-1
Thenotebook demonstrates a hybrid approach combining the Grey GM(1,1) Model with a Markov Chain to forecast Indonesia'soil and gas export values, enhance accuracy, and provide a robust state-based prediction. The process integrates timeseries prediction, error state classification, Markov transition analysis, and accuracy evaluation.
